# NBA Statistics Web Scraping and Predictive Modeling Project

## Overview

This project focuses on collecting NBA player statistics from the Proballers website through web scraping and leveraging the gathered data to build a predictive model. The aim is to analyze player performance and develop insights that can contribute to a predictive model for future performance predictions.

## Project Structure

- data_scraping: Contains scripts for web scraping NBA statistics from Proballers.

- data_analysis: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.

- modeling: Code for building and evaluating predictive models.

- results: Store the results of the predictive models, visualizations, and any other relevant outputs.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install re
pip install pandas
```

## Data Collection

1. Run the web scraping script in the data_scraping folder to gather NBA player statistics from Proballers.

2. Store the collected data in the data directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the collected data using Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the data_analysis folder. Perform data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering to gain insights into the dataset.
## Modeling

Implement predictive models using machine learning algorithms. The modeling folder contains code for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
## Results

Store the results of your predictive models, visualizations, and any other relevant outputs in the results directory.
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flannelmonke/HoopsForecast_Pro.git
```
1. Follow the steps in the "Data Collection," "Exploratory Data Analysis," and "Modeling" sections.

2. Use the models for predictions or further analysis.
