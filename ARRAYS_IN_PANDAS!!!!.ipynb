Among the statistics we are not including in this update (but which we hope to expand in the future) are minutes played, games started, personal fouls, turnovers and offensive/defensive rebounds. Without minutes played we are also unable to calculate most advanced statistics for these seasons at this time. However, we are able to calculate True Shooting Percentage and Effective Field Goal Percentage since we have the needed shooting statistics.</p>\\n<p>These new statistics can seen on <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/\">player pages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/#all_NCAAW_schools\">school pages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/maac/women/1988-stats.html\">conference season registers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/ivy/women/leaders/\">conference leaderboards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/leaders/\">national leaderboards</a>.</p>\\n<p>We have acquired this data from <a href=\"https://sportsdataresearch.com/\">Sports Data Research</a>, which does excellent work and has provided us with similar historical college football data in the past. The current data is largely built off of the scans that schools sent to the NCAA after their seasons and were subsequently scanned to <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/\">NCAA.org</a>. There are often issues with these scans: difficult to decipher numbers, typos, handwritten errors, smudges, missing players, missing games, etc. For instance, on<a href=\"https://web1.ncaa.org/app_data/statsPDFArchive/WBB1/Women\\'s%20Basketball_Women\\'s_Division%20I_1994_746_University%20of%20Virginia.pdf\"> this sheet</a> you\\'ll notice players with FG percentages that don\\'t make sense and a player with 2 points but no made FG or FT. We have been able to correct these, but it is sometimes not possible to do so. Additionally, It was common practice for the team\\'s main rotation players to appear on these sheets and then other players would get blended into a row labeled \\'others\\' with their statistics all combined. Some stat sheets list very players, such as <a href=\"https://web1.ncaa.org/app_data/statsPDFArchive/WBB1/Women\\'s%20Basketball_Women\\'s_Division%20I_1999_796_University%20of%20Wisconsin,%20Madison.pdf\">this one</a>. We have elected to not put these \\'others\\' rows onto our site. Generally speaking, errors are the exception to the rule, but they can be difficult to correct without access to game-level data. Sports Data Research and Sports Reference will be working to improve this data over time.</p>\\n<p>We would also like to thank the <a href=\"https://www.sloansportsconference.com/\">Sloan Sports Analytics Conference</a> for their grant which enabled us to purchase this data. We appreciate their common commitment to expanding access to women\\'s sports data and thank them for their generous gift to support us in this mission.</p>\\n<p>As previously mentioned, we will be expanding this data in the future. This will go beyond things like cleaning and expanding data for the seasons we already have. We will also be adding player and team statistics back to the first year of NCAA involvement with women\\'s college basketball (1981-82).\\xa0 Once we get back that far, it would be great to add AIAW data, as well, but that will require some further planning. Currently, we have women\\'s NCAA basketball schedules back to 2002-03. We will continue working with Sports Data Research and the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference to extend that coverage back to 1981-82, as well. We also plan to add opponent statistics (on a season level) back as far as possible. The existing data for the early and mid-80s is generally of a lesser quality compared to what you find today, but we are committed to unearthing and displaying as much of it as possible.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, we would like to mention that there are three schools that team stat sheets do not seem to exist for:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/alabama-am/women/2001.html\">2000-01 Alabama A&amp;M</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/texas-southern/women/2001.html\">2000-01 Texas Southern</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/bethune-cookman/women/1990.html\">1989-90 Bethune-Cookman</a>. If you happen to have access to these statistics, we would love to add them, so please <a href=\"https://www.sports-reference.com/feedback/\">let us know</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>About Sports Reference LLC:</strong><br />\\nSports Reference’s family of websites is the internet\\'s leading, easy to use resource for current and historical sports data, biographical information, and advanced statistics.

       "     'value': '<p><a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp.shtml\">Most Valuable Player Awards</a> in the National and American Leagues date back to 1911, when the Chalmers Award was voted on by a writer from each league city to reward the player in each league who \"should prove himself as the most important and useful player to his club and to the league at large in point of deportment and value of services rendered.\" The reward for winning was an automobile. The award was created in 1910, but was for winning the batting title and ended in controversy. So from 1911-14 the award went to an MVP from each league. Interest in the award waned, and so from 1915-21 no MVPs were awarded.</p>\\n<p>In 1922, the American League MVP returned, followed by the return of the NL MVP in 1924. The rules for the AL MVP drew criticism since voters had to vote for one player (and only one player) from each team, player/managers (popular at the time) could not receive votes and no player could win the award more than once. So, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ruthba01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Babe Ruth</a> won the AL MVP in 1923, and then was not eligible to win subsequent awards for a number of years. The NL used a separate set of rules for selecting its MVPs, which were better, but imperfect.</p>\\n<p>In 1928 <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cochrmi01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mickey Cochrane</a> was AL MVP in a season in which Ruth and Gehrig were the no-brainer top candidates, but each was ineligible on account of having been previous winners. This robbed the award of some meaning. And so on May 6, 1929 the AL decided to not award an MVP in the 1929 season. The NL would later come to the same conclusion, but decided to award an MVP in 1929, but then not have one in 1930. So the 1929 season has an official NL MVP, but no AL MVP. And the 1930 season has no official MVPs. The leagues have officially awarded MVPs since 1931, leaving these three awards as missing links.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/\">Baseball Reference</a>, like the American and National Leagues, has never printed AL MVPs for 1929 and 1930, or an NL MVP in 1930. However, thanks to the research of <a href=\"https://sabr.org/sabr-salute/bill-deane/\">SABR member Bill Deane</a>, we are now including information on unofficial MVPs for these league seasons. This was also spurred by a site user pointing out to us that <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cronijo01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Cronin</a>\\'s 1930 AL MVP is engraved on his plaque in Cooperstown.</p>\\n<p>These awards were voted on by two separate committees in each instance, with each roughly replicating previous voting rules. In essence, these votes used the same/similar procedures, each using one voter from each league city and then publishing the results in newspapers and announcing the winner. The only difference is the lack of the stamp of officialdom. In 1929, <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fonsele01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lew Fonseca</a> was voted unofficial AL MVP by the BBWAA, while <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/simmoal01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Al Simmons</a> was voted the winner by The Sporting News. By combining the results of these two polls, we arrive at Fonseca as the unofficial winner. Full combined voting results can be seen <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1929.shtml\">here</a>. It\\'s interesting to note that Fonseca benefitted from the rule preventing a writer from giving a vote to more than one player from any given team, as the Philadelphia A\\'s greats (<a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/foxxji01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmie Foxx</a>, <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dykesji01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmy Dykes</a>, Al Simmons, Mickey Cochrane, etc.) split the vote. Meanwhile, Babe Ruth, ostensibly the best player in the World in 1929, received votes in the BBWAA poll, but not in the TSN poll.</p>\\n<p>Cronin swept both of the writers\\' polls for the 1930 AL Award, despite Al Simmons having more first-place votes. The one vote per team rule hurt Simmons, as some writers put <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/grovele01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lefty Grove</a> or Mickey Cochrane on their ballot, while Cronin drew all of the votes for his team. In the National League, <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/terrybi01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Terry</a> was voted MVP by The Sporting News, while <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wilsoha01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hack Wilson</a> was the winner of the BBWAA poll. Combining the two makes Hack Wilson the unofficial 1930 NL MVP. <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/friscfr01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&amp;utm_source=www.sports-reference.com&amp;utm_campaign=2024-01-24_br\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Frankie Frisch</a> and Terry led in first-place votes with six each. Full voting results for 1930 can be seen <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1930.shtml\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>While the voting methodology used in 1929 and 1930 had many of the same warts that plagued earlier versions of the awards, ultimately we decided it was merely a technicality that they didn\\'t receive \\'official\\' awards and that the truest version of history would be to present these awards on the site given that they were voted on at that time and in a similar manner as previous awards. So we have updated the site to include these awards for Lew Fonseca, Joe Cronin and Hack Wilson, while also noting that they are \"unofficial.\"</p>'}]},\n",

       "     'value': '<p>If you peruse the NBA Guide (the name of the NBA\\'s official record book produced before every season) you\\'ll notice that most team scoring records for quarters are restricted to \\'since 1954-55\\', which is when the NBA first introduced the shot clock. Before that, games tended to be lower scoring, particularly in late and close situations as teams held out for possession of the ball at the end of the game. It is also often hard to find record of how much was scored in a given quarter before the shot clock as the league was generally less popular and recaps, let alone box scores, were less thorough. However, at <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/\">Basketball-Reference</a> we view it as important to attempt to preserve as many recordable facts about these games as possible. We are frequently making minor improvements to our box scores in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s. Thanks to some help from NBA research ace Todd Spehr, we have recently added quarter-by-quarter scoring to the vast majority of the BAA and NBA games from 1946-47 through 1953-54 that were previously missing these details. Before this recent work, we were missing these details on 709 games. We were able to add complete data for 569 of them and partial data for 62 of them. This leaves fewer than 100 games completely lacking scoring breakdowns. For instance, what the NBA considers the first game in the history of the league (though it was actually a BAA game) between the Knicks and Huskies on November 1, 1946 now has a <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/194611010TRH.html\">complete scoring breakdown</a>, with the Knicks winning despite coming up with just six points in the third quarter. Chicago Stags home games in this era might be particularly fun to look at because, as a marketing tactic, they decided to play 15-minute quarters in several home games such as <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/194703080CHS.html\">this</a>, <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/194702060CHS.html\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/194701230CHS.html\">this</a>. Minutes played were not yet an official statistic, so it\\'s unclear if any Stags were averaging over 50 MPG for some home games. We hope you enjoy these new additions.</p>'}]},\n",
